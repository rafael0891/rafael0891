- 👋 Hi, I’m @rafael0891
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and like to explore new things. I have enough knowledge on HTML, CSS and Javascript for front-end development. I do learn some frameworks
like css framework which is bootstrap4 and javascript framework jQuery. I also have skills in PHP for server-side development and RDBMS (MySQL/MariaDB) which I
use for database, basic skills in photoshop, powershell scripting, MS Excel scripting and more. 
I have enough experience using Ubuntu Linux, Apache Web-server, and cloudflare. Theres so many interesting things that I want to learn from this community as a developer.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites and web application development
